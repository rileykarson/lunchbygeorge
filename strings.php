Our January figures are also a little lower, but it was still the second highest January demand for food in the 26 years for which we have records. There has been an increased demand for clothing and our clients were especially grateful for a wonderful donation of winter apparel from the Cunningham Swan law firm. "

In addition, we served about 9000 soups at 10 o’clock each morning. The soups are becoming more and more popular. Our great adventure of the year was starting to grow our own vegetables in the Lakeshore Community Garden, under the inspired leadership of John Poland. We also welcomed more regular sponsors and look forward to their continued support."

We look forward to repeating the garden’s success this year, and look forward to meeting volunteers who could help us with its cultivation."

They are often overlooked with the emergence of newer programmes with higher profiles, yet they have been consistent in providing quality meals to our homeless and low-income neighbours, regardless of the attention'. Thank you for those kind words, and thank you, Regina Rosen, for creating the Fund. The money will be well used."
