Our January figures are also a little lower, but it was still the second highest January demand for food in the 26 years for which we have records. There has been an increased demand for clothing and our clients were especially grateful for a wonderful donation of winter apparel from the Cunningham Swan law firm. "

In addition, we served about 9000 soups at 10 o’clock each morning. The soups are becoming more and more popular. Our great adventure of the year was starting to grow our own vegetables in the Lakeshore Community Garden, under the inspired leadership of John Poland. We also welcomed more regular sponsors and look forward to their continued support."

We received special funding for the Dinner from Awesome Kingston, the Cataraqui-Kingston Rotary Club, Windmills Restaurant and a number of individuals. We were also able to give Christmas stockings to about 60 of our regular clients full of personal items (soap, deodorant, shampoo, etc) and winter clothing."

We now have a plot 110 by 25 feet, and in 2014 this produced 1900 pounds of vegetables. There were weekly deliveries to our kitchen, and we still have much frozen, or in the Loving Spoonful bank. We look forward to repeating the garden’s success this year, and look forward to meeting volunteers who could help us with its cultivation."
