				<h1>Demand Continues</h1>
				<p>
					The number of clients we served showed a slight decline in 2012, but not enough to suggest that there is no longer a need for our services. we served 8790 soups (a 1% decline) and 11307 meals (a 5% decline). Our January figures are also a little lower, but it was still the second highest January demand for food in the 26 years for which we have records. There has been an increased demand for clothing and our clients were especially grateful for a wonderful donation of winter apparel from the Cunningham Swan law firm
